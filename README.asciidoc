== dman-reluctant

Fetch Debian man pages from the Internet on-demand, and render them to a local pager.  This is a reimplementation of https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/debian-goodies/dman.1.en.html[`dman`] for people who prefer not to run Debian -- or Linux -- locally.

Currently requires https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/[`groff`] (GNU `troff`).

To read the Debian manual for `dpkg-source(1)` as it exists in Debian `stable`, invoke:

----
dman dpkg-source
----

To read the same manual as it existed in an older Debian release, invoke:

----
dman --release jessie dpkg-source
----

Downloaded manual pages are cached to `~/.dman/cache`.

The `MANPAGER` and `PAGER` environment variables are honoured.

`grotty` is told to draw boldfaced and underlined characters using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overstrike[overstriking].  Many pagers, like `less`, will make perfect sense of this simple drawing scheme.
