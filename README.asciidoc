== dman-reluctant

Fetch Debian man pages from the Internet on-demand, and render them to a local pager.  This is a reimplementation of https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/debian-goodies/dman.1.en.html[`dman`] for people who prefer not to run Debian -- or Linux -- locally.

Currently requires https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/[`groff`] (GNU `troff`).
